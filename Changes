Revision history for Config-Tree

0.10     2014-09-19 (PERLANCAR) - not yet released

         - This is a reboot of the old Config-Tree I wrote in 2009. The new
           interface is not totally different but has some incompatibilities
           with the old one. The 2009 version contains functionalities that have
           now been put in various separate distributions, e.g. Rinci/Perinci.
           The new version is more like a filesystem (we now have the concept of
           mounting and can list the content of a directory), but leave out
           merging.
